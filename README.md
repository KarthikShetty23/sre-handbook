# 🐧 Linux & Git Learning Journey

> **Status:** 🟢 Active Learning (Phase 1)
> 
> **Goal:** Building the foundation for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

This repository serves as my personal laboratory and documentation hub. Here, I document every Linux command, Git workflow, and Networking concept I master on my journey to becoming a Cloud Engineer.

## 🐙 Git Workflow
*The SRE standard workflow for version control.*

```bash
# 1. Start a new feature
git checkout -b feature-name

# 2. Save work
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"

# 3. Upload to Cloud
git push origin feature-name
```
