# Linux Distributions and Families

## The Core Concept
* **The Kernel:** The "Engine. " It handles the hardware, memory and CPU. It is the same across all the Linux System.
* **The Distribution (Distro):** The "Car Model." It includes the kernel plus specific tools, desktop environments, and  **Package Managers**.

## The two Main Families (SRE focus)

|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Parent Distro** | Debian | Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL) |
| **Popular Kids** | **Ubuntu**, kali, mint | **Fedora**, CentOS, Rocky, Alma |
| **Package Manager** | `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) | `dnf` (Modern) or `yum` (old) |

## Key Terminology
* **RPM:** Just the file format(like `.exe` in Windows). It stands for *Red Hat Package Manager*.
* **YUM/DNF:** The tools that actually download and install RPMs (handling dependencies Automatically). `.dnf` is the newer and faster vesion of `yum`.
